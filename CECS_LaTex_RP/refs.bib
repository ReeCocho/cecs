abstract = {North American bat species have been undergoing extreme population declines due to the White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) epidemic caused by the spread of its pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Existing models that represent the spread of the disease are limited in their scalability for use in management decisions or lacked the sophistication necessary to capture the complexity of WNS spread. Grounded in the theory of geoexpression, we exploit the latent structure of geographical process concurrency by implementing our modeling software using a concurrent Entity Component System architecture. We demonstrate our model’s computational tractability for millions of individual bats. This work is significant because it lays the foundation for the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure and cyberGIS to address challenges in geographical wildlife epidemiology that can be understood using dynamic geographical Individual-Based Models.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Interaction framework based on the Entity-Component-System model (ECS). In this model, interactive elements (Entities) are characterized only by their data (Components). Behaviors are managed by continuously running processes (Systems) which select entities by the Components they possess. This model facilitates the handling of behaviors and promotes their reuse. It provides developers with a simple yet powerful composition pattern to build new interactive elements with Components. It materializes interaction devices as Entities and interaction techniques as a sequence of Systems operating on them. We present Polyphony, an experimental toolkit implementing this approach, and discuss our interpretation of the ECS model in the context of GUIs programming.},
