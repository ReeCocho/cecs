1. Introduction
	- What is an ECS

2. Related Work
	- Legion Paper (Also other Rust ECS, SPECS, BevyECS)
	- Difference between Storage Based ECS and Archetype ECS
	- Usage outside of games (Radar simulation?)

3. Our ECS Model
	- Archetypes (Why it was chosen and data structure)
	- What works and what didn't
	- Scheduling algorithm

4. Correctness
	- Inspiration from Rust (XOR rule)
	- PRW lock (maybe?)

5. Performance
	- Degenerate cases (A depends on B depends on C...)
	- Comparison with serial
	- Comparison with other ECS (https://github.com/rust-gamedev/ecs_bench_suite)
